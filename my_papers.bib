	abstract = {Short peptide hydrogels are attractive biomaterials but typically suffer from limited mechanical properties. Inclusion of other nanomaterials can serve the dual purpose of hydrogel reinforcement and of conferring additional physicochemical properties (e.g., self-healing, conductivity), as long as they do not hamper peptide self-assembly. In particular, nanocarbons are ideal candidates, and their physicochemical properties have demonstrated great potential in nanocarbon-polymer gel biomaterials for tissue engineering or drug delivery. Recently, increasing interest in supramolecular hydrogels drove research also on their enhancement with nanocarbons. However, little is known on the effect of nanocarbon morphology on the self-assembly of short peptides, which are among the most popular hydrogel building blocks. In this work, three different oxidized nanocarbons (i.e., carbon nanotube or CNT as 1D material, graphene oxide sheet or GO as 2D material, and carbon nanohorn or CNH as 3D material) were evaluated for their effects on the self-assembly of the unprotected tripeptide Leu-DPhe-DPhe at physiological conditions. Supramolecular hydrogels were obtained in all cases, and viscoelastic properties were clearly affected by the nanocarbons, which increased stiffness and resistance to applied stress. Notably, self-healing behavior was observed only in the case of CNTs. Tripeptide–nanotube interaction was noted already in solution prior to self-assembly, with the tripeptide acting as a dispersing agent in phosphate buffer. Experimental and in silico investigation of the interaction between peptide and CNTs suggests that the latter acts as nucleation templates for self-assembly and reassembly. Overall, we provide useful insights for the future design of composite biomaterials with acquired properties.},

The present work contributes to this investigation through the study of the aqueous exfoliation of four types of graphene sources, which are namely graphite and graphite nanoflakes with different morphologies and geographical origins. The exfoliation was achieved in an aqueous solution of a soluble pyrene derivative that was synthesized to achieve maximum interaction with the graphene surface at low concentration (5 \&times; 10\&minus;5 M). The yield of bilayer and few-layer graphene obtained was quantified by Raman spectroscopic analysis, and the adsorption of the pyrene derivative on the graphene surface was studied by thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction. The whole procedure was rationalized with the help of molecular modeling.},

	abstract = {Antiamoebin I (AAM-I) and zervamicin II (Zrv-IIB) are peptaibols that exert antibiotic activity through the insertion/disruption of cell membranes. In this study, we investigated how the folding of these peptaibols are affected when some of their native residues are replaced with proline analogues and asymmetrical D-α,α-dialkyl glycines (two classes of noncanonical amino acids). Systematic substitutions of native Aib, Pro, Hyp, and Iva residues were performed to elucidate the folding properties of the modified peptaibols incorporating noncanonical residues. The secondary structure of a peptaibol influences its ability to incorporate into membranes and therefore its function. Our findings reveal that native Zrv-IIB unfolds considerably in water. The presence of Iva and the noncanonical proline analogue cis-3-amino-L-proline (ALP) in both peptaibols induces helical structures. Inserting asymmetric glycines such as α-methyl-D-leucine (MDL) and α-methyl-D-phenylalanine (MDP) into the peptaibols induces folding. This preorganization in water may help to overcome the energy barrier required for peptaibol insertion into the membrane, as well as to facilitate the formation of transmembrane channels.

Both carbon nanostructures were compared due to their different chemical structure: GO is a G derivative with oxygen functional groups which should promote a closer chemical interaction with TiO2 nanoparticles. Computational models of the fundamental properties of the composites indicated potentially improved photocatalytic activity compared to TiO2, namely lower band gaps and charge carrier segregation at the interfaces. These fundamental properties match qualitatively experimental results on methylene blue, which was more effectively degraded by TiO2/G and TiO2/GO nanocomposites than by pure TiO2 under UV light. In contrast, the same nanocomposites were found to be less efficient to degrade ciprofloxacin than pure TiO2 under visible and UV light. Therefore, this work showcases the relevance of an efficient matching between the catalyst and the molecular properties and structure of the pollutant.},

In this work, the effect of increasing concentrations of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the activity of pure cultures of methanogens and on typical fatty acid-degrading syntrophic methanogenic coculture was evaluated. CNT affected methane production by methanogenic cultures, although acceleration was higher for hydrogenotrophic methanogens than for acetoclastic methanogens or syntrophic coculture. Interestingly, the initial methane production rate (IMPR) by Methanobacterium formicicum cultures increased 17 times with 5 g·L−1 CNT. Butyrate conversion to methane by Syntrophomonas wolfei and Methanospirillum hungatei was enhanced (∼1.5 times) in the presence of CNT (5 g·L−1), but indications of DIET were not obtained. Increasing CNT concentrations resulted in more negative redox potentials in the anaerobic microcosms. Remarkably, without a reducing agent but in the presence of CNT, the IMPR was higher than in incubations with reducing agent. No growth was observed without reducing agent and without CNT. This finding is important to re-frame discussions and re-interpret data on the role of conductive materials as mediators of DIET in anaerobic communities. It also opens new challenges to improve methane production in engineered methanogenic processes.},

The β–CD/MWCNT modified GC electrode exhibited efficient electrocatalytic behavior in the oxidation of ciprofloxacin with relatively high sensitivity, stability and lifetime. Molecular modeling studies showed that ciprofloxacin binds preferably to β–CD rather than to CNT edges, leading to an improved sensitivity of the sensor. Under optimized conditions, a linear calibration curve was obtained for ciprofloxacin in the concentration range 10–80 µM with a detection limit of 50 nM.

	abstract = {The rules that govern spin exchange interaction in pristine graphene nanostructures are constrained by the bipartite character of the lattice, so that the sign of the exchange is determined by whether magnetic moments are on the same sublattice or not. The synthesis of graphene ribbons with perfect zigzag edges and a fluoranthene group with a pentagon ring, a defect that breaks the bipartite nature of the honeycomb lattice, has been recently demonstrated. Here we address how the electronic and spin properties of these structures are modified by such defects, both for indirect exchange interactions as well as the emergent edge magnetism, studied both with density functional theory and mean-field Hubbard model calculations. In all instances we find that the local breakdown of the bipartite nature at the defect reverts the sign of the otherwise ferromagnetic correlations along the edge, introducing a locally antiferromagnetic intraedge coupling and, for narrow ribbons, also revert the antiferromagnetic interedge interactions that are normally found in pristine ribbons. Our findings show that these pentagon defects are a resource that permits us to engineer the spin exchange interactions in graphene-based nanostructures.},

	abstract = {Different reactions have been reported for the successful functionalization of carbon nanotubes (CNT). The Diels-Alder cycloaddition is recognized as a plausible chemical approach, but few reports are known where this strategy has been used. In this study, the functionalization was performed by 1,3-butadiene generated from 3-sulfolene under heating conditions in diglyme. This simple and easily scalable method resulted in functionalized CNT with mass losses of 10–23\% by thermogravimetric analysis (nitrogen atmosphere). The functionalization was also supported by acid-base titration, elemental analysis, temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high content in oxygen detected on the CNT surface was assigned to anhydride formation due to a cascade oxidation of the alkene groups generated in the cycloaddition reaction. The complete evolution of the alkene leads to a grafting density of 4.2 mmol g−1 for the anhydride moiety. Ab-initio calculations in CNT model systems indicate that the Diels-Alder addition of butadiene is a feasible process and that subsequent oxidation reactions may result in the formation of the anhydride moiety. The presence of the anhydride group is a valuable asset for grafting a multitude of complex molecules, namely through the nucleophilic addition of amines.},

	abstract = {Don't cry! The attachment of ferrocene moieties on the surface of carbon nano-onions influences the electrochemical properties of these moieties and the photophysical properties of the carbon nano-onions (see figure). Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the spectral properties of carbon nano-onions depend on their size and the degree of functionalisation. We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel ferrocene–carbon onion derivative, where ferrocene acts as an electron-donating moiety, while the carbon nano-onion (CNO) serves as the electron acceptor. CNOs were functionalized by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and the resulting products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and energy dispersive spectroscopies. The electronic properties of the Fc–CNO derivative were investigated by electrochemical and photophysical techniques, complemented by quantum chemical calculations. On average, the CNOs have a spherical appearance with six shells. Functionalization saturates one carbon atom in 36 carbon atoms on the outer cage of the CNO. Through-space interactions between the Fc moiety and the CNO core were detected electrochemically. Fluorescence was observed at low and high energies with an intrinsic decay that is faster at lower energies. Based on theory and experiment, we conclude that, after absorption of a photon at low energy, there is emission from CNOs characterized by larger external shells and a lower degree of functionalization. At high energy, emission comes from CNOs with smaller external shells and a higher degree of functionalization.},

As it becomes a bottleneck on multi-core systems, higher throughput alternatives must be considered, exploring parallelism and/or more effective compression schemes. This work provides a comparative study of the ZLIB, LZ4 and FPC compressors (serial and parallel implementations), focusing on CR, bandwidth and speedup. LZ4 provides very high throughput (decompressing over 1GB/s versus 120MB/s for ZLIB) but its CR suffers a degradation of 5-10\%. FPC also provides higher throughputs than ZLIB, but the CR varies a lot with the data. ZLIB and LZ4 can achieve almost linear speedups for some datasets, while current implementation of parallel FPC provides little if any performance gain. For the ROOT dataset, LZ4 was found to provide higher CR, scalability and lower memory consumption than FPC, thus emerging as a better alternative to ZLIB.},

	abstract = {When a pesticide is released into the environment, most of it is lost before it reaches its target. An effective way to reduce environmental losses of pesticides is by using controlled release technology. Microencapsulation becomes a promising technique for the production of controlled release agricultural formulations. In this work, the microencapsulation of chlorophenoxy herbicide MCPA with native β-cyclodextrin and its methyl and hydroxypropyl derivatives was investigated. The phase solubility study showed that both native and β-CD derivatives increased the water solubility of the herbicide and inclusion complexes are formed in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. The stability constants describing the extent of formation of the complexes have been determined by phase solubility studies. 1H NMR experiments were also accomplished for the prepared solid systems and the data gathered confirm the formation of the inclusion complexes. 1H NMR data obtained for the MCPA/CDs complexes disclosed noticeable proton shift displacements for OCH2 group and H6 aromatic proton of MCPA provided clear evidence of inclusion complexation process, suggesting that the phenyl moiety of the herbicide was included in the hydrophobic cavity of CDs. Free energy molecular mechanics calculations confirm all these findings.

The gathered results can be regarded as an essential step to the development of controlled release agricultural formulations containing herbicide MCPA.},

Our results given by energy decomposition analysis show that the dispersion contribution, ?Edisp, is the most important contribution to the interaction energy, ?Eint. However, it is not enough to compensate the Pauli repulsion term, ?EPauli, and the roles of the orbital contribution, ?Eorb, and, in particular, the electrostatic contribution, ?Eelstat, become crucial for the stabilization of the structures in the intercalation process. On the other hand, for G?C/C?G systems, hydrogen-bonding (HB) interactions are more important than stacking (S) interactions, whereas for A?T/T?A systems, HB and S become competitive. Moreover, intercalation produces important changes not only in the hydrogen bonds of base pairs, because S and HB are deeply connected, but also in other characteristic geometric parameters of the base pairs.},

The extent of CNT oxidation evaluated by TGA increased with the time of reflux in nitric acid. The CNTox surface coverage by quinoid/phenolic functional groups was quantified by their voltammetric response at low redox potentials. Cyclic voltammetry was performed with SPCE-CNTox on solutions of hydroquinone, dopamine and ferricyanide used as model compounds. The sensitivity of reduced/oxidized forms of these molecules to the oxygen-containing functional groups of the CNTox was evaluated by the current intensity. Compounds with phenol/amine groups show a large increase of the current intensity with increasing CNT oxidation, while for carbonyl containing compounds only a negligible effect was perceived. Molecules that can hydrogen bond to the CNT functional groups interact better with the electrode surface, and this is supported by theoretical calculations. This showcases the use of CNTox modified SPCE for selective sensing.},

The SWNHs were ESR active with linewidth (ΔH) of ∼6 G in vacuo at room temperature. ΔH was susceptible to the partial pressure of O2 and became 53 G at 1 atmospheric pressure of O2, while the integrated ESR intensity was independent on O2 pressure and behaved as Curie-like, suggesting an intrinsic ESR origin with localized electron spin character. The diamagnetic susceptibility for SWNHs indicated a value smaller than that of randomly oriented graphite by an order of magnitude, but showing a magnitude comparable to those of C60 and C70. It is suggested that the large diamagnetism expecting for sp2 networked carbon materials will be canceled by the Van Vleck constant paramagnetism.},

Very accurate CCSD(T) results are used as reference data for the benzene dimer, and the new method is shown to reproduce accurately its binding energies with small basis sets. After geometry optimization our new scheme performs better than the other methods. This approach generates proper geometries and accurate binding energies, even with small basis sets.

The addition of non-planar, sterically bulky chains to the fullerene cage results in highly ordered 1D structures in which the fullerenes are evenly spaced along the internal nanotube cavity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the functional groups interact with neighbouring fullerene cages to space the fullerenes evenly within the confines of the nanotube.

A detailed picture of the molecular mode of action of such a delivery is, however, difficult to obtain because of the concealing effects of the cell membrane. Here we report a systematic computational study of membrane insertion of individual carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles using two entirely different and unrelated techniques. First a static scan of the environmental free energy is carried out based on a membrane mimicry approach and different insertion geometries are assessed. Then the dynamics is investigated with a coarse-grained approach that was previously used in the study of the integration dynamics of nanoparticles into the bilayer. The results of both models point, for unfunctionalized carbon nanotubes, at a preference for the horizontal orientation inside the internal hydrophobic layer of the cell membrane. Finally, the energetics of the formation of bundles of carbon nanotubes is studied. The cellular membrane promotes aggregation of carbon nanotubes in its hydrophobic core and modifies the structural stability of the bundles.},

The novel composite electrode also exhibited durable operation (6.5\% decline in capacitance over 100 000 cycles) as a result of its monolithic chemical composition and mechanical stability. The novel composite electrode was benchmarked against another high-power electrode made from single-walled carbon nanotubes (Bucky paper electrode). While the composite electrode had a lower surface area compared to the Bucky paper electrode (280 vs 470 m2/g from nitrogen adsorption), it had a higher meso-macro pore volume (2.6 vs 1.6 mL/g from mercury porosimetry) which enabled the composite electrode to retain more electrolyte, ensuring facile ion transport, hence achieving a higher maximum power rating (970 vs 400 kW/kg).},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotube tapers are a set of nanostructures comprised of straight tubular sections with decreasing diameters, joined to each other via conical funnels and terminated with a hemispherical cap. The funnels are formed with the help of topological defects, which minimally include at least one pentagon-heptagon pair. The structural, electronic, and transport properties of tapers are analyzed using realistic tight-binding models. Specifically, it is shown that straight nanotube tapers are monochiral objects. Among a variety of possible taper structures, kinetics of the growth process suggests that the most prevalent tapers will have either zigzag or armchair structures. Their scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images have been simulated for identification purposes. The STM images of tapers are dominated by a protruding pentagon inherent in the taper structure, which unfortunately does not allow for an easy identification of the chirality of the underlying nanotubes. Turning to transport properties, it is shown that zigzag-based tapers will likely be poor conductors, because of gaps induced by the semiconducting segments. Armchair-based tapers, on the other hand, are characterized by a finite conductance at low bias voltages and make attractive prototypes for nanoscale probes and devices.},

Its electronic structure is studied by the simple tight-binding models for a monolayer nanotube. The method of the development map is used to systematically define the atomistic structures of the cap. The topological feature of the bond network is determined by the configuration of the six five-membered rings. The effects of such topological features on electronic structure are elucidated by the model in which the hopping integrals and the site energies are taken to be common at every atom. Though there are neither disorder of the potential nor that of the coordination number, some localized states emerge around the cap. The wave function and the energy eigenvalue can be obtained analytically for simpler cases. These results show explicitly that the localized states are formed by an analytic continuation of the wave number from the real number space to the complex number space. Some of them are near the Fermi level and coexist with the extended states in the same energy. The effects of magnetic field parallel to the tube axis are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Multiple five- and seven-membered rings in graphene surfaces have long-range effects which are very sensitive to their relative placement. The sensitivity is described by an “n-m” combination rule derived here. This rule classifies graphene cones by the localized fictitious gauge flux through their apices, leading to two classes of graphene cones with two apical pentagons. The local density of states vanishes at the Fermi energy in one class, but in the other, it is nonzero and decreases inversely with distance from the apex. Fictitious apical flux also affects the response of electrons to a magnetic field, leading to position dependent local degeneracy of Landau levels as well as anomalous Landau levels which are semiclassically linked to cyclotron orbits which encircle the apex multiple times before closing. We derive these results in a continuum theory, but confront them with numerical tight-binding computations, finding good agreement. We also discuss an intrinsic Aharonov-Bohm effect which persists in the ray-optics limit, and possibilities for producing different inhomogeneous effective fields by exploiting the conical shape.},

	abstract = {Cisplatin (CDDP) was incorporated inside single-wall carbon nanohorns with holes opened (SWNHox) by a nanoprecipitation method that involved dispersion of CDDP and SWNHox in a solvent followed by the solvent evaporation. The incorporated CDDP quantity increased from the previously reported value of 15 to 46\%, and the total released quantity of CDDP also increased from 60 to 100\% by changing the solvent from dimethylformamide to water. Concurrently, in vitro anticancer efficiency of CDDP@SWNHox increased to 4−6 times greater than that of the intact CDDP. In vivo, CDDP@SWNHox intratumorally injected to transplanted tumors of mice suppressed the tumor growth more than the intact CDDP. We observed that CDDP@SWNHox adhered to the cell surfaces in vitro and stayed within the tumor tissues in vivo. Therefore, we think that the CDDP released from SWNHox realized high concentrations locally at the cells in vitro and in the tissues in vivo and could efficiently attack the tumor cells. We also found that SWNHox itself had an in vivo anticancer effect, which might increase the anticancer activities of CDDP@SWNHox.},

The oxide surface has been represented by clusters of ions embedded in point charges or by periodic slabs of various thickness. The methods used to compute adsorption energies, geometries and vibrational modes are Hartree–Fock and density functional theory. Coverage and surface relaxation effects have been explicitly considered. The bonding and vibrations of adsorbed CO have been analyzed by decomposing the interaction energy into the sum of various contributions. This analysis shows that the interaction of CO with the five-coordinated Sn ions of the surface has a large electrostatic character reinforced by a substantial donation of charge from CO to the cation. The CO adsorption is rather weak; the adsorption energy is ∼0.25\&\#xa0;eV, but is accompanied by a large shift of the vibrational frequency towards higher values (Δω≈+80\&\#xa0;cm−1).},

	abstract = {We studied the mono- and the antipodal bis-adduct of C60 and anthracene with FT-Raman spectroscopy. Due to the reduced symmetry, the adducts have a much larger number of Raman-active modes than C60 with its icosahedral symmetry. Especially interesting is the fact that in the region of the C60 pentagonal pinch mode (PPM) the adducts show two strong peaks, of which the higher one is almost at the same frequency as the C60 mode and the lower one is downshifted by 5.4 and 10.5 cm−1 for the mono- and bis-adduct, respectively. The higher frequency peak could be explained by a degradation of the adducts into C60. However, calculated Raman spectra of the pure adducts also show two strong peaks in the PPM region, of which the higher frequency one is not PPM related. Finally, the C–H vibrations are the only clear evidence for anthracene in the adduct spectra.},

These new structures “unify” graphene edge topology, the most stable flat hydrogenated graphene edges always consisting of pairwise bonded C2H4 edge groups, irrespective of the edge orientation. When edge rippling is included, CH3 edge groups are most stable. These new fundamental hydrogen-terminated edges have important implications for graphene edge imaging and spectroscopy, as well as mechanisms for graphene growth, nanotube cutting, and nanoribbon formation and behavior.},

CO2 interacts electrostatically with the five-coordinated Sn cations; the molecule is bound with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface and is slightly distorted compared with the gas-phase molecule. On the bridging oxygen anions and in the limit of zero coverage, CO2 is chemisorbed with the formation of a surface carbonate; the process, however, is almost thermoneutral and the chemisorbed state is metastable. As the coverage increases, the adsorbate–adsorbate repulsion make the formation of chemisorbed CO2 unfavorable. The non-defective SnO2 surface exhibits therefore very little reactivity towards CO2.},

Intermolecular bonds of the type 5/5 2+3 cycloaddition are induced between each C60 molecule and its twelve nearest neighbors in the face centered cubic lattice. Remarkably, this bonding creates on octahedral sites new C60 cages, identical to the original ones, and on tetrahedral sites distorted sodalite-like cages. The resulting carbon clathrate has a Pm3¯ simple cubic structure with half of the original face centered lattice constant. Eighty percent of its atoms are sp3-hybridized, driving a narrow-gap semiconducting behavior, a moderate bulk modulus of 268 GPa and an estimated hardness of 21.6 GPa. This new phase is likely to be prepared by subjecting C60 to high pressure and high temperature conditions.},

Understanding the mechanism of such processes at the (sub)molecular level is crucial to improve predictive synthesis and to tailor material properties for applications in catalysis7–10 and (opto)electronics11,12, among others13–18. We characterize a model boroxine 2D dynamic covalent polymer, by using in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy, to unveil both qualitative and quantitative details of the nucleation–elongation processes in real time and under ambient conditions. Sequential data analysis enables observation of the amorphous-to-crystalline transition, the time-dependent evolution of nuclei, the existence of ‘non-classical’ crystallization pathways and, importantly, the experimental determination of essential crystallization parameters with excellent accuracy, including critical nucleus size, nucleation rate and growth rate. The experimental data have been further rationalized by atomistic computer models, which, taken together, provide a detailed picture of the dynamic on-surface polymerization process. Furthermore, we show how 2D crystal growth can be affected by abnormal grain growth. This finding provides support for the use of abnormal grain growth (a typical phenomenon in metallic and ceramic systems) to convert a polycrystalline structure into a single crystal in organic and 2D material systems.},

	abstract = {Tailored synthesis of nanographenes, and especially graphene nanoribbons (GNR), has been achieved on metal substrates via a bottom-up approach from organic precursors, which paves the way to their application in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Since quantum confinement in nanographenes leads to the creation of peculiar band structures, strongly influenced by their topological characteristics, it is important to be able to exactly engineer them in order to precisely tune their electronic, optical and magnetic properties. However practical application of these materials requires post-synthesis transfer to insulating substrates. Recently, cyclodehydrofluorination of fluorinated organic precursors has been shown to be a promising pathway to achieve metal-free bottom-up synthesis of nanographenes. Here we present how to apply in situ laser annealing to induce cyclodehydrofluorination leading to nanographene formation directly on non-metallic surfaces. In this work, we analyze the changes in the Raman fingerprint of the fluorinated precursor tetrafluoro-diphenyl-quinquephenyl (TDQ) during the laser annealing process in high vacuum (HV), demonstrating that both heating and photo-induced processes influence the cyclization process. Hence, in situ laser annealing allows not only to influence chemical reactions, but also to have a fast and contact-free monitoring of the reaction products. Optimization of the laser annealing process adds a new level of control in the tailored synthesis of nanographenes on non-metallic substrates. This is a very promising pathway to unravel the full application potential of nanographenes in general and GNR in particular, enabling a fast optimization of precursor molecules and substrate geometry engineered for specific applications.},

Detailed investigation using powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with a local probe method, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealed details of COF growth and nucleation at the nanoscale. A boronate ester COF undergoes preferential growth in the a–b crystallographic plane under solvothermal conditions. Carbon nanotubes were found to not impact the mode of COF growth, but the crystallites on nanotubes were smaller than COF crystallites not on supports. COF crystalline regions with sizes of tens of nanometres exhibited preferred orientation on nanotube surfaces, where the c-axis is oriented between 50 and 90° relative to the carbon surface. The COF/nanotube hybrid structure was found to be more complex than the previously suggested concentric core–shell model and can be better described as a nanocrystalline scaly COF/nanotube hybrid.},

The intercalation was further confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the experimental results have been rationalized with DFT calculations. Covalently functionalized CNO derivatives were synthesized by using phenyl iodide and n-hexyl iodide as electrophiles in model nucleophilic substitution reactions. The functionalized CNOs were exhaustively characterized by statistical Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, UV–vis, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies.

	abstract = {Several antitumor drugs base their cytotoxicity on their capacity to intercalate between base pairs of DNA. Nevertheless, it has been established that the mechanism of intercalation of drugs in DNA starts with the prior groove binding mode of interaction of the drug with DNA. Sometimes, for some kind of flat small molecules, groove binding does not produce any cytotoxic effect and the fast transition of such flat small molecules to the cytotoxic intercalation mode is desirable. This is the case of methylated phenanthroline (phen) derivatives, where, changes in the substitution in the position and number of methyl groups determine their capability as cytotoxic compounds and, therefore, it is a way for the modulation of cytotoxic effects. In this work, we studied this modulation by means of the interaction of the [Pt(en)(phen)]2+ complex and several derivatives by methylation of phen in different number and position and the d(GTCGAC)2 DNA hexamer via groove binding using PM6-DH2 and DFT-D methods. The analysis of the geometries, electronic structure and energetics of the studied systems was compared to experimental works to gain insight into the relation structure-interaction for the studied systems with cytotoxicity. The trends are explained by means of the Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) index, the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) and solvation contributions. Our results are in agreement with the experiments, in which the methylation of position 4 of phen seems to favour the interaction via groove binding thus making the transition to the intercalation cytotoxic mode difficult. Looking at the NCI results, these interactions come not only from the CH/π and CH/n interactions of the methyl group in position 4 but also from the ethylenediamine (en) ligand, whose orientation in the Pt complex was found in such a way that it produces a high number of weak interactions with DNA, especially with the sugar and phosphate backbone.},

In this work, we investigate crystallization of glycine using graphene, with different surface chemistry, as a template. We show that graphene induces the preferential crystallization of the metastable α-polymorph compared to the unstable β-form at the contact region of an evaporating droplet. Computer modeling indicates the presence of a small amount of oxidized moieties on graphene to be responsible for the increased stabilization of the α-form. In conclusion, our work shows that graphene could become an attractive material for polymorph selectivity and screening by exploiting its tunable surface chemistry.},

The as-received CNFs present an electrical conductivity of {\textasciitilde}320 S m−1 and an interesting phenomenon of showing negative S-values of −5.5 μVK−1, with 10−2 µW/mK2 as the power factor (PF). In contrast, the PP/CNF composites with 5 wt. \% of CNFs showed lower conductivities of {\textasciitilde}50 S m−1, less negative S-values of −3.8 μVK−1, and a PF of 7 × 10−4 µW/mK2. In particular, the change in the Seebeck coefficient of the PP/CNF composites is explained by a slight electron donation from the outer layers of the CNFs to the PP molecules, which could reduce the S-values of the as-received CNFs. Our study indicates that even insulating polymers such as PP may have a quantifiable effect on the intrinsic Seebeck coefficient of carbon-based nanostructures, and this fact should also be taken into consideration to tailor conductive polymer composites with the desired thermoelectric (TE) properties.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are currently one of the most explored materials for developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications. Some of the 2D metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (M2P2X6 or MPX3 in its simplified form) have been reported to be useful catalysts for water splitting, although results have been less promising for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to insufficient activity or compromised stability. Herein, we report the OER catalysis of a series of M2P2X6 (M2+ = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cd; X = S, Se). From the series of MPX3, CoPS3 yields the best results with an overpotential within the range of values usually obtained for IrO2 or RuO2 catalysts. The liquid-phase exfoliation of CoPS3 even improves the OER activity due to abundant active edges of the downsized sheets, accompanied by the presence of surface oxides. The influence of the OER medium and underlying substrate electrode is studied, with the exfoliated CoPS3 reaching the lowest overpotential at 234 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, also able to sustain high current densities, with an overpotential of 388 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm2, and excellent stability after multiple cycles or long-term operation. Quantum chemical models reveal that these observations are likely tied to moieties on CoPS3 edges, which are responsible for low overpotentials through a two-site mechanism. The OER performance of exfoliated CoPS3 reported herein yields competitive values compared to those reported for other Co-based and MPX3 in the literature, thus holding substantial promise for use as an efficient material for the anodic water-splitting reaction.},

Such porous materials present certain additional advantages such as, for example, an immense structural and functional versatility, combination of porosity with multiple electronic properties and the possibility of tuning their physical properties by post-synthetic modifications. In this Review, we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs and COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and function relationships. The different building blocks have been classified based on the electronic nature and main function of the resulting porous frameworks.

A thorough analysis is presented of the spin-state energetics of Clar Goblet and bowtie nanographenes by a battery of existing and novel ab initio procedures ranging from density functional theory to complete active space Hamiltonians. With this, it was proven that π radicals of bowtie nanographenes sit on BP (Benzo[cd]Pyrene) moieties driven by their local aromaticity, a purely chemical concept, which confers global stability to the whole structure. Besides, a novel Pauli energy densities analysis provided a visual intuitive explanation for this preference. These findings allow envisioning that analogous bowtie nanographenes with arbitrary polyradical character are not only feasible at the molecular scale but will share Clar Goblet's peculiar properties.},

To preserve phosphorene’s essential characteristics, for example, influencing the charge redistribution and generating the formation of active centers, noble-metal decoration is found to be an efficient approach. Herein, we demonstrate a single-step electrochemical synthesis of platinoid-decorated few-layer phosphorene (FP). The material’s structure and effects of metal (Ru, Rh, and Pd) deposition on the FP nanosheets were first explored by numerous analytical techniques and theoretical calculations. Platinoid-decorated FPs demonstrate high quality and consist of one to five layers modified with round- and heptagon-shaped metal nanoparticles with the most intense distribution of Pd. The high-rate Rh deposition provides the enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency for hydrogen evolution (79 mV·dec–1—Tafel slope) and almost 20 times increased capacity for the Li-ion batteries in comparison to bare and Ru-decorated FP. The chemosensing of platinoid-decorated FP indicates a response to methanol plus ethanol and shows inertness to acetone. The incorporation of Ru and Rh nanoparticles increases FP’s selectivity toward methanol. This research provides a new approach for the in situ FP functionalization during top-down synthesis and thus broadens the material’s feasibility for advanced nanotechnology.},

However, carbon-based catalysts only show promising catalytic activity in alkaline solution. Concurrently, the most optimized polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells use proton exchange membranes. This means that the cathode electrode is surrounded by a protonic environment in which carbon materials show poor performance, with differences above 0.5 V in EONSET for nondoped carbon materials. Therefore, the search for highly active carbon-based catalysts is only possible if we first understand the origin of the poor electrocatalytic activity of this kind of catalysts in acidic conditions. We address this matter through a combined experimental and modeling study, which yields fundamental principles on the origin of the pH effects in ORR for carbon-based materials.

MM yields the best results with three force fields MM3, OPLS, and AMOEBA, which reproduced nine out of the ten stationary points of the benzene dimer. We obtained new parameters for MM3 and OPLS that successfully reproduce all structures of the benzene dimer and showed improved accuracy over DFT-D in most dimer geometries. Semiempirical models were, unexpectedly, less accurate than MM methods. The most accurate semiempirical method for the benzene dimer is PM6-DH2. DFT-D was the only Hamiltonian that reproduced the variations of energy with geometry from CCSD(T) calculations accurately and is the method of choice for energies of periodic and molecular calculations of graphitic systems. In contrast, MM represents an accurate alternative to calculate geometries.},

	abstract = {Vapor grown carbon nanofiber (CNF) based ink dispersions were used to dip-coat woven cotton fabrics with different constructional parameters, and their thermoelectric (TE) properties studied at room temperature. Unlike the positive thermoelectric power (TEP) observed in TE textile fabrics produced with similar carbon-based nanostructures, the CNF-based cotton fabrics showed negative TEP, caused by the compensated semimetal character of the CNFs and the highly graphitic nature of their outer layers, which hinders the p-type doping with oxygen groups onto them. A dependence of the electrical conductivity (σ) and TEP as a function of the woven cotton fabric was also observed. The cotton fabric with the largest linear density (tex) showed the best performance with negative TEP values around − 8 μV K−1, a power factor of 1.65 × 10−3 μW m−1 K−2, and a figure of merit of 1.14 × 10−6. Moreover, the possibility of a slight e− charge transfer or n-doping from the cellulose onto the most external CNF graphitic shells was also analysed by computer modelling. This study presents n-type carbon-based TE textile fabrics produced easily and without any functionalization processes to prevent the inherent doping with oxygen, which causes the typical p-type character found in most carbon-based TE materials.},

	abstract = {The motion of molecular fragments in close contact with atomically flat surfaces is still not fully understood. Does a more favorable interaction imply a larger barrier toward motion even if there are no obvious minima? Here, we use mechanically interlocked rotaxane-type derivatives (MINTs) of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) featuring four different types of macrocycles with significantly different affinities for the SWNT thread as models to study this problem. Using molecular dynamics, we find that there is no direct correlation between the interaction energy of the macrocycle with the SWNT and its ability to move along or around it. Density functional tight-binding calculations reveal small ({\textless}2.5 kcal·mol–1) activation barriers, the height of which correlates with the commensurability of the aromatic moieties in the macrocycle with the SWNT. Our results show that macrocycles in MINTs rotate and translate freely around and along SWNTs at room temperature, with an energetic cost lower than that for the rotation around the C–C bond in ethane.},

The presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on GQDs surface and edges provides an excellent opportunity to explore them as anchoring units for covalent functionalization. In addition, the nonlinear optical response of GQDs allows the development of optical sensors operating in biological media. To evaluate the possibility of using GQDs to introduce a hydrophobic sensing unit inside animal cells and to add a nonlinear response to the sensing unit we prepared a novel hybrid based on GQDs covalently linked to corrole units bearing a glycol branch. Covalent functionalization was supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Both the height and the diameter of the hybrid showed distributions peaking below 4 nm. The UV–vis absorption and emission spectra of the hybrids were additive with respect to that of the GQDs and the corrole. Insights about the most stable conformation of the corrole with respect to the GQDs core was provided by in silico studies using a model structure. The internalization and distribution of the hybrids in live animal cells was evaluated in human breast adenbocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7 cells) using confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Notably, multiphoton microscopy allowed for image collection using nonlinear excitation in the near-infrared and emission in the red part of the visible spectra.},

The nanomaterials were extensively characterized with experimental and in silico techniques. Next, they were applied to phosphopeptide enrichment from cancer cell lysates for NanoHPLC-MS/MS, with selectivity as high as nearly 90\% and several-thousand identification hits.

The photovoltaic performance clearly depended on the molecular structure of the fulleropyrrolidine substituents although no direct correlation with the surface morphology of the photoactive layer, as determined by atomic force microscopy, could be established. Although some fulleropyrrolidines possess favorable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, when compared to the standard PC71BM, they originated OPV cells with inferior efficiencies than PC71BM-based reference cells. Fulleropyrrolidines based on C60 produced, in general, better devices than those based on C70, and we attribute this observation to the detrimental effect of the structural and energetic disorder that is present in the regioisomer mixtures of C70-based fullerenes, but absent in the C60-based fullerenes. These results provide new additional knowledge on the effect of the fullerene functionalization on the efficiency of organic solar cells.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, photocatalysis has arisen as a solution to degrade emerging pollutants such as antibiotics. However, the reduced photoactivation of TiO2 under visible radiation constitutes a major drawback because 95\% of sunlight radiation is not being used in this process. Thus, it is critical to modify TiO2 nanoparticles to improve the ability to absorb visible radiation from sunlight. This work reports on the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with gold (Au) nanoparticles by deposition-precipitation method for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The produced nanocomposites absorb 40\% to 55\% more radiation in the visible range than pristine TiO2, the best results being obtained for the synthesis performed at 25 \&deg;C and with Au loading of 0.05 to 0.1 wt. \%. Experimental tests yielded a higher photocatalytic degradation of 91\% and 49\% of ciprofloxacin (5 mg/L) under UV and visible radiation, correspondingly. Computational modeling supports the experimental results, showing the ability of Au to bind TiO2 anatase surfaces, the relevant role of Au transferring electrons, and the high affinity of ciprofloxacin to both Au and TiO2 surfaces. Hence, the present work represents a reliable approach to produce efficient photocatalytic materials and an overall contribution in the development of high-performance Au/TiO2 photocatalytic nanostructures through the optimization of the synthesis parameters, photocatalytic conditions, and computational modeling.},

	abstract = {Among higher fullerenes that obey the isolated pentagon rule (IPR), there is an appreciable share of fullerenes with open electron shells. For a long time, this rule was used as a criterion for fullerene stability. Notwithstanding the IPR, fullerene radicals are unstable as pristine fullerenes but may be stabilized as their derivatives. Mainly, the molecules of such fullerenes contain phenalenyl-radical substructures. Here, for the first time, we found and theoretically investigated a new radical substructure of fullerene molecules of IPR isomer 7 (C3v) of C82 that bears two unpaired electrons and of IPR isomer 822 (D3d) of C104 with two equivalent substructures (four unpaired electrons). The fullerenes were obtained, and their molecular structures reliably characterized experimentally as endohedral derivatives. According to our computations, two hypothetical polyaromatic radical molecules C34H18 and C34H12, which are the models of the fullerene substructure, have the same open-shell triplet ground states. Peculiarities of distribution of spin densities of radical substructures are disclosed.},

Herein, we describe a new solid-state ordering strategy that allows obtaining 1D mixed π-stacks of acene and azaacene derivatives. In addition, we illustrate that charge transport can be modulated by the electronic nature of the encapsulated phenazine, opening new perspectives in the design, preparation and development of supramolecular organic semiconductors.},

	abstract = {The design of advanced N-doped carbon materials towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis is only possible if the nature of the active sites is fully understood. There is an important piece of research seeking to overcome this challenge through experimental or theoretical results. However, the combination of both approaches is necessary to deepen the knowledge about this subject. This work presents excellent agreement between experimental results and computational models, which provides evidence of the nature of the most active sites in N-doped carbon materials. N-doped carbon materials have been experimentally obtained through double stage treatment of polyaniline in distinct atmospheres (both oxygen-containing and inert atmospheres) at different temperatures (800–1200 °C). According to temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Raman spectroscopy, N2-adsorption isotherms at −196 °C and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), this synthesis method results in the selective formation of nitrogen species, without significant changes in structural order or porosity. ORR catalytic tests evidence the highly efficient catalysis, with platinum-like performance in terms of the current density and onset potential, of N-doped carbon materials selectively containing graphitic-type nitrogen species. Computational chemistry, through DFT calculations, shows that edge-type graphitic nitrogen is more effective towards ORR catalysis than pyridinic, pyrrolic, pyridonic, oxidized and basal-type graphitic nitrogen species.},

The corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined by cyclic voltammetry, from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. Some of the novel fullerenes have higher LUMO levels than the standards PC61BM and PC71BM. When tested in PffBT4T-2OD based polymer solar cells, with the standard architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active-Layer/Ca/Al, these fullerenes do not bring about any efficiency improvements compared to the standard PC71BM system, however they show how the electronic nature of the different substituents strongly affects the efficiency of the corresponding organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The functionalization of C70 yields a mixture of regioisomers and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that these have systematically different electronic properties. This electronic inhomogeneity is likely responsible for the lower performance observed in devices containing C70 derivatives. These results help to understand how new fullerene acceptors can affect the performance of OPV devices.},

The objective of this work is to study and understand the fundamental interactions between cholinium chloride and urea that lead to the experimentally observed melting temperature depression. To do so, the structure of urea was strategically and progressively modified, in order to block certain interaction centres, and the solid–liquid equilibrium data of each new binary system was experimentally measured. Using this approach, it was concluded that the most important interaction between cholinium chloride and urea occurs through hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion and the amine groups. Any blockage of these groups severely hampers the melting point depression effect. Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations were utilized to study in more detail this hydrogen bonding and its nuances.},

In this work, the eutectic temperatures of new choline chloride-based eutectic systems were experimentally assessed. These data, along with other previously reported in the literature, were used to evaluate a method based on COSMO-RS to predict the eutectic temperature of choline-chloride based mixtures. The predictive methodology herein developed allows for the quick scanning of a large matrix of systems in order to identify those more promising to be in the liquid state at a given temperature. To validate this method, the eutectic temperature of pharmaceutical drug mixtures was predicted and, then, assessed experimentally, showing that COSMO-RS is useful in the design of liquid drug-based formulations.},

It was found that intermolecular bonds, 56/56 2 + 2 cycloaddition, are formed between molecules with different orientations but no bonds are formed between molecules with the same orientation. The computed bulk moduli for these structures gave values ranging from 88 to 132 GPa.

Here we provide a set of rules to correctly predict the existence of zero mode states as well as the spin multiplicity of both the ground state and the low-lying excited states, together with their open- or closed-shell nature. This is accomplished using a combination of analytical arguments and configuration interaction calculations with a Hubbard model, both backed by quantum chemistry methods with a larger Gaussian basis set.

The concave–convex self-complementarity of the wavy two-dimensional lattice guides the stacking of framework layers into a highly stable and ordered covalent organic framework that allows a full 3D analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealing its chairlike honeycomb facets and aligned mesoporous channels. Remarkably, the waviness of the framework does not disrupt the interlayer π–π stacking that shows charge transporting properties similar to those of planar covalent organic frameworks. The implementation of core-twisted aromatics as building blocks for covalent organic frameworks brings new possibilities in the design of highly ordered organic materials.},

	abstract = {Controlling the edge morphology and terminations of graphene nanoribbons (GNR) allows tailoring their electronic properties and boosts their application potential. One way of making such structures is encapsulating them inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. Despite the versatility of Raman spectroscopy to resolve strong spectral signals of these systems, discerning the response of long nanoribbons from that of any residual precursor remaining outside after synthesis has been so far elusive. Here, the terrylene dye is used as precursor to make long and ultra-narrow armchair-edged GNR inside nanotubes. The alignment and characteristic length of terrylene encapsulated parallel to the tube's axis facilitates the ribbon formation via polymerization, with high stability up to 750 °C when the hybrid system is kept in high vacuum. A high temperature annealing is used to remove the terrylene external molecules and a subtraction model based on the determination of a scaling factor related to the G-band response of the system is developed. This not only represents a critical step forward toward the analysis of the nanoribbon-nanotube system, but it is a study that enables unraveling the Raman signatures of the individual CH-modes (the signature of edge passivation) for GNR for the first time with unprecedented detail.},

At 30 °C, the PEEK/CNF composites show an electrical conductivity (σ) of {\textasciitilde}27 S m−1 and a Seebeck coefficient (S) of −3.4 μV K−1, which means that their majority charge carriers are electrons. The origin of this negative Seebeck is deduced because of the impurities present in the as-received CNFs, which may cause sharply varying and localized states at approximately 0.086 eV above the Fermi energy level (EF) of CNFs. Moreover, the lower S, in absolute value, found in PEEK/CNF composites, when compared with the S of as-received CNFs (−5.3 μV K−1), is attributed to a slight electron withdrawing from the external layers of CNFs by the PEEK matrix. At temperatures from 30 °C to 100 °C, the σ (T) of PEEK/CNF composites, in contrast to the σ (T) of as-received CNFs, shows a negative temperature effect, understood through the 3D variable-range hopping (VRH) model, as a thermally activated hopping mechanism across a random network of potential wells. Moreover, their nonlinear S (T) follows the same behavior reported before for polypropylene composites melt-processed with similar CNFs at the same interval of temperatures.},

Herein, MIMIIIP2S6 (MI = Cu, Ag; MIII = Sc, V, Cr, In) are synthesized and tested for the first time as electrocatalysts in alkaline media, towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and HER. AgScP2S6 follows a 4 e− pathway for the ORR at 0.74 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode; CuScP2S6 is active for HER, exhibiting an overpotential of 407 mV and a Tafel slope of 90 mV dec−1. Density functional theory models reveal that bulk AgScP2S6 and CuScP2S6 are both semiconductors with computed bandgaps of 2.42 and 2.23 eV, respectively and overall similar electronic properties. Besides composition, the largest difference in both materials is in their molecular structure, as Ag atoms sit at the midpoint of each layer alongside Sc atoms, while Cu atoms are raised to a similar height to S atoms, in the external segment of the 2D layers. This structural difference probably plays a fundamental role in the different catalytic performances of these materials. These findings show that MI(Cu, Ag) together with Sc(MIII) leads to promising achievements in MIMIIIP2S6 materials as electrocatalysts.},

The major shortcoming of synthesized thermodynamically very unstable layered germanene and silicene with their inclination toward oxidation was overcome by topochemical deintercalation of a Zintl phase (CaGe2, CaGe1.5Si0.5, and CaGeSi) in a protic environment. The exfoliated Ge–H, Ge0.75Si0.25H, and Ge0.5Si0.5H were successfully synthesized and employed as the active layer for photoelectrochemical photodetectors, which showed broad response (420–940 nm), unprecedented responsivity, and detectivity on the order of 168 μA W–1 and 3.45 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W–1, respectively. The sensing capability of exfoliated germanane and silicane composites was explored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with ultrafast response and recovery time of less than 1 s. These positive findings serve as the application of exfoliated germanene and silicene composites and can pave a new path to practical applications in efficient future devices.},

Recently, relevant technological improvements have been made in terms of accelerators as suitable neutron sources for NCT at hospitals. However, low selective delivery of current drugs to cancer cells remains as the main challenge for successful clinical application of NCT. This work presents an innovative and previously unexplored approach for the design of nanotherapeutic NCT agents. Herein, a new concept based on carbon nanomaterials that seal 6Li active NCT nuclides is investigated. The 6Li active species are located in the inner cavity of the nanocarrier (carbon nanohorns or carbon nanotubes) and therefore, completely protected from the biological environment, avoiding toxicity and degradation. After encapsulation of the active cargo, the external surface of the nanocarrier is modified for improved biocompatibility. The developed 6Li-filled carbon nanohorns offered the possibility to explore 6Li compounds as active NCT agents by delivering therapeutic doses to cancer cells. We envisage that nanoencapsulation of 6Li can trigger the successful development and implementation of Lithium Neutron Cancer Therapy (LiNCT).},

	abstract = {A one-step procedure is reported for the synthesis of a crystalline magnetic covalent organic framework (COF) composite. While pre-functionalization of the solid substrate with a building block prior to COF growth is typically required to obtain a crystalline COF composite, our approach uses a sub-stoichiometric amount of the diamino building block during the COF synthesis. This allows for the anchoring of the excess aldehyde on the dopamine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles to promote COF growth, giving access to crystalline magnetic COF composite in only one step. No losses in crystallinity or surface area were observed as compared to bulk material. The COF composite was successfully applied for the removal of okadaic acid from synthetic seawater, where the composite material showed adsorption efficiency comparable to that found for the bulk COF. In addition, the material was recyclable during at least three consecutive cycles of adsorption/desorption using 2-propanol as desorption solvent, with merely minor losses in adsorption capacity. This work opens new avenues for synthesizing crystalline COF composites through shorter and easier routes, saving costs of sorbent preparation, and reinforces the great promise of COF composites for application in seawater biotoxin monitoring.},

Self-assembly of the DT-TTF-tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied by using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen-bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H-bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT-TTF derivatives towards the design and construction of novel π-extended electroactive frameworks.},

	abstract = {Self-assembled peptide-based hydrogels are archetypical nanostructured materials with a plethora of foreseeable applications in nanomedicine and as biomaterials. N-protected di- and tri-peptides are effective minimalist (molecular) hydrogelators. Independent variation of the capping group, peptide sequence and side chain modifications allows a wide chemical space to be explored and hydrogel properties to be tuned. In this work, we report the synthesis of a focused library of dehydrodipeptides N-protected with 1-naphthoyl and 2-naphthylacetyl groups. The 2-naphthylacetyl group was extensively reported for preparation of peptide-based self-assembled hydrogels, whereas the 1-naphthaloyl group was largely overlooked, owing presumably to the lack of a methylene linker between the naphthalene aromatic ring and the peptide backbone. Interestingly, dehydrodipeptides N-capped with the 1-naphthyl moiety afford stronger gels, at lower concentrations, than the 2-naphthylacetyl-capped dehydrodipeptides. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the self-assembly of the dehydrodipeptides is driven by intermolecular aromatic π–π stacking interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the 1-naphthoyl group allows higher order aromatic π–π stacking of the peptide molecules than the 2-naphthylacetyl group, together with hydrogen bonding of the peptide scaffold. The nanostructure of the gel networks was studied by TEM and STEM microscopy and was found to correlate well with the elasticity of the gels. This study contributes to understanding the interplay between peptide and capping group structure on the formation of self-assembled low-molecular-weight peptide hydrogels. Moreover, the results presented here add the 1-naphthoyl group to the palette of capping groups available for the preparation of efficacious low-molecular-weight peptide-based hydrogels.},

Non-canonical amino acids appear widely distributed in nature and are known to enhance the stability of specific secondary structures and/or biological function. Contrary to the ubiquitous DNA-encoded amino acids, the structure and function of these residues are not fully understood. Here, results from experimental and molecular modelling approaches are gathered to classify several classes of non-canonical amino acids according to their ability to induce specific secondary structures yielding different biological functions and improved stability. Regarding side-chain modifications, symmetrical and asymmetrical α,α-dialkyl glycines, Cα to Cα cyclized amino acids, proline analogues, β-substituted amino acids, and α,β-dehydro amino acids are some of the non-canonical representatives addressed. Backbone modifications were also examined, especially those that result in retro-inverso peptidomimetics and depsipeptides. All this knowledge has an important application in the field of peptidomimetics, which is in continuous progress and promises to deliver new biologically active molecules and new materials in the near future.},

	abstract = {Several dimerization products of fullerene C60 are presented and thoroughly characterized with a quantum chemical DFT model augmented by dispersion. We reanalyze and expand significantly the number of known dimers from 12 to 41. Many of the novel bonding schemes were found by analyzing more than 2 ns of high energy molecular dynamics semiempirical trajectories with AutoMeKin, a methodology previously used to compute the reactivity of much smaller molecules. For completeness, this was supplemented by structures built by different geometric considerations. Also, spin-polarization was explicitly considered yielding 12 new bonding schemes with magnetic ground states. The results are comprehensively analyzed and discussed in the context of yet to be explained 3D fullerene structures and recent fullerene 2D systems.},
